    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python is a technique that allows the execution of multiple threads of code concurrently within the same process. \n",
    "In other words, it allows multiple functions or pieces of code to execute simultaneously, rather than waiting for one function to finish before starting another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python to improve the performance and responsiveness of applications. \n",
    "By executing multiple threads concurrently, the application can utilize the available resources more efficiently and respond to user input faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a built-in 'threading module' to handle threads. \n",
    "This module allows us to create and manage threads in our Python code. \n",
    "It provides a high-level interface for creating and starting new threads and provides synchronization primitives like locks and semaphores for controlling the access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    print(\"Executing my_function in thread:\", threading.current_thread().name)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new thread and start it\n",
    "my_thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function)\n",
    "my_thread.start()\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. Why threading module used? Write the use of the following functions\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module is used in Python to create and manage threads. \n",
    "It provides a high-level interface for creating and starting new threads and provides synchronization primitives like locks and semaphores for controlling the access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common reasons for using the threading module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Concurrent execution: \n",
    "By using the threading module, we can execute multiple pieces of code simultaneously, which can improve the performance and responsiveness of our applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Parallel processing: \n",
    "Threads can be used for parallel processing, where multiple threads can work on different parts of a problem in parallel, which can lead to faster execution times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Asynchronous programming:\n",
    "Threads can be used for asynchronous programming, where multiple tasks can be executed in parallel and the results can be combined when all tasks are complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Shared resource access: \n",
    "The threading module provides synchronization primitives like locks and semaphores for controlling the access to shared resources. \n",
    "This can help prevent race conditions and ensure that multiple threads can safely access shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the uses of the functions in the threading module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.activeCount(): \n",
    "This function is used to get the number of active threads in the current threads ThreadGroup. \n",
    "It returns the number of threads that are alive and have been started. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.currentThread(): \n",
    "This function returns a reference to the current thread object, which represents the thread from which the function is called. \n",
    "This function can be useful for identifying the current thread and accessing its attributes, such as its name, identification number, or stack trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.enumerate(): \n",
    "This function returns a list of all currently active thread objects in the current threads ThreadGroup. Each thread object is represented by a Thread instance. \n",
    "This function can be useful for debugging or monitoring purposes, where we need to know the details of all the threads that are currently running in our program."

    "The following are the functions of the Thread class in the threading module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.run(): \n",
    "This method represents the code that is executed by the thread when it is started. \n",
    "We override this method in a subclass of Thread to define the behavior of the thread. \n",
    "The run() method should contain the code that we want the thread to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.start(): \n",
    "This method is used to start the thread. \n",
    "It creates a new operating system-level thread and calls the run() method of the thread. \n",
    "Once a thread is started, it runs independently of the main thread of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.join(): \n",
    "This method is used to wait for a thread to complete. \n",
    "When we call the join() method on a thread, the current thread will block until the target thread finishes executing. \n",
    "This can be useful for ensuring that all threads complete before the program exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.isAlive(): \n",
    "This method is used to check whether a thread is still executing. \n",
    "It returns True if the thread is currently running, and False otherwise. \n",

    "1.Increased efficiency: \n",
    "Multithreading can improve the efficiency of a program by allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously. \n",
    "This can result in faster execution times and improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Responsiveness: \n",
    "Multithreading can help to make a program more responsive by allowing it to continue executing while performing time-consuming operations in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Resource sharing: \n",
    "Multithreading allows threads to share resources, such as memory and CPU time, which can be more efficient than having separate processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Modularity: \n",
    "Multithreading can help to modularize a program by breaking it up into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be executed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Simplified coding: \n",
    "Multithreading can simplify the coding of certain types of programs, such as those that require event handling or user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Complexity: \n",
    "Multithreading can add complexity to a program, making it more difficult to write, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Synchronization:\n",
    "Multithreading can introduce synchronization issues, such as race conditions and deadlocks, which can be difficult to detect and resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Overhead: \n",
    "Multithreading can add overhead to a program, such as the overhead of creating and managing threads and the overhead of synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Resource contention: \n",
    "Multithreading can lead to resource contention issues, such as multiple threads competing for the same resource, which can degrade performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Debugging: \n",
    "Debugging multithreaded programs can be more difficult than debugging single-threaded programs, due to the increased complexity and the possibility of race conditions and other synchronization issues."

    "\n",
    "Deadlock:\n",
    "A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource that they need in order to continue executing.\n",
    "Deadlocks occur when each thread holds a resource that the other thread needs, and neither thread is willing to release its resource until it can acquire the other resource. \n",
    "As a result, both threads become blocked and unable to proceed, causing the program to hang.\n",

    "A race condition is a situation where the behavior of a program depends on the timing or order of execution of multiple threads.\n",
